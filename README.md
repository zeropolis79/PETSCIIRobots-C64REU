# PETSCIIRobots-C64REU
Attack of the Petscii Robots - C64 REU 
The Attack of the PETSCII Robots source code has been provided by David Murray for the 

purposes of study and also to provide information to those who would like to port the game 

to other systems. This code may NOT be used to produce unofficial copies for sale and the 

code must NOT be modified in anyway unless adding a feature, in which both the source and 

compiled versions must be sent to David Murray. 

Due to time constraints, David Murray will NOT be prodiving support. He has gladly given 

permission for me to host this.

The Commodore 64 REU and Commodore 128 versions were coded by Scott Robison, who sadly 

passsed away in August 2022, so please do not attempt to contact his family to ask 

questions about it. His widow found the folder containing the source code to these 

versions but we have no way of knowing if these are the latest builds.
